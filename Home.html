                <h1>Welcome to the Unruly Kingdom</h1>
                <p>Welcome to the Unruly Kindom where UnrulySalami reigns supreme!<br>
                The tyrant King, the bratwurst, was the ruler of the land.  He piggybacked off of the backs of the hotdogs, hamburgers and salamis his entire life and rose to power.  All of the lowly other finger foods were used as slaves to the king and his High Court of other brats, but there was one <b>unruly salami</b> who changed everything... <br>
                <br>
                The uprising was swift and brutal.  After an epic battle, UnrulySalami cast the tyrant King onto the grill where the titans of the land devoured the tyrant.  UnrulySalami gave the King's high court the boot of justice, to live as Unruly did on the face-level part of the fridge, subject to the whims of the titans.  All is chaotic after the uprising, but the law of the land is now Just and things are better than ever before.</p>

                <p>UnrulySalami, aka Brad Pearce, is an Xbox gamer and Streamer, who started streaming while playing Call of Duty.  Brad has been playing video games since he was 3 years old, starting with the classic NES system (Nintendo) and playing various systems all the way up to today, focusing on Xbox One at the moment.  Brad streams on <a href="https://www.mixer.com/unrulysalami"> mixer.com</a>.  Brad's ambitions are to start a family, continue to stream and play games (and want's to make it part of his career), but in addition, he wants to become a software engineer and teach people what he is learning along the way, through streams and free youtube content.</p>
        
                <p>Brad recently lost his job working in the oil and gas industry and is making a bold and risky move to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, Node and React (for a start) in a short amount of time to change careers to adapt to the ever developing Tech landscape and land a career that will pay off in the long run.  During this time, Brad will be spending at least 4 hours a day studying and writing code while gaming in the evenings/at night.  Please visit Unruly's pages, support his stream and youtube channel, and if you are feeling generous help support him through his endeavor to provide good gaming content and free computer programming tutorials to help educate the world.</p>
